GreenEnviro : K-Means Clustering Indonesia Climate

# Project Description
This project delved into the intricate patterns of weather using K-Means Clustering method. We then matched these patterns with early warning maps for heavy rain and droughts

To achieve such output, I apply several CRISP-DM Techniques:

* Business Understanding: Knowing Weather Characteristic Patterns in Indonesian Regions and Creating Early Warning Maps of High Rainfall and Meteorological Drought in each region of Indonesia
* Data Understanding: Understand the data, characteristics, and correlation each variables.
* Data Preparation: checking data quality, doing data cleaning, transform data and feature selection.
* Modelling: Doing clustering model based on number of cluster optimal.
* Evaluation: Model evaluation using Silhoutte Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
